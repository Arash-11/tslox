```
program        → declaration* EOF ;

declaration    → varDecl
               | statement ;

varDecl        → "var" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression )? ";" ;

statement      → exprStmt
               | printStmt ;

exprStmt       → expression ";" ;

printStmt      → "print" expression ";" ;



expression     → assignment ;

assignment     → IDENTIFIER "=" assignment
               | equality ;

equality       → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;

comparison     → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;

term           → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;

factor         → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;

unary          → ( "!" | "-" ) unary

primary        → "true" | "false" | "nil"
               | NUMBER | STRING
               | "(" expression ")"
